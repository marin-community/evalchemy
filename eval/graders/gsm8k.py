"""Self-contained grader for the lm-eval-harness ``gsm8k`` task.

Ports the filter chains and ``exact_match`` metric of
``lm_eval/tasks/gsm8k/gsm8k.yaml`` at the pinned lm-evaluation-harness
``v0.4.12`` so grading needs only the problem text, the model's solution, and
the reference answer.

The task defines two filters over the same metric, and both are reproduced:
``strict-match`` reads the ``#### <number>`` line the few-shot targets end
with, and ``flexible-extract`` falls back to the last number anywhere in the
completion.

Extraction is a single regex in both the reference and here, so the cost that
can be removed is in the metric. ``exact_match_hf_evaluate`` runs its four
``regexes_to_ignore`` as uncompiled ``re.sub`` calls over both sides, wraps each
result in a fresh ``numpy`` array, lowercases through ``np.char.lower``, and
reduces a one-element comparison with ``np.mean`` -- per grade. The
substitutions are all expressible as string operations, which is what this
module does; ``\\.$`` stays a compiled regex because ``$`` also matches before a
trailing newline.
