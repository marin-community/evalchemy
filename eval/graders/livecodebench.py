"""Self-contained, bounded grader for the LiveCodeBench (LCB) test format.

One grader replaces the four vendored LCB execution stacks (``LiveCodeBench``,
``LiveCodeBenchv5``, ``LiveCodeBenchv5_official``, ``LiveBench/lcb_runner``). Each candidate
runs in one child process with bounded memory and wall-clock time, and the parent reaps it
deterministically, so a runaway candidate is bounded wherever the RL reward path (or a
benchmark) grades it.

The shape follows ``eval.graders.humaneval`` -- one child process, pipe transport, watchdog
kill, deterministic reap -- with the bounds the vendored stacks lacked:

- a memory cap wired by default (``RLIMIT_AS``/``RLIMIT_DATA``/``RLIMIT_STACK``), applied
  best-effort (some platforms, e.g. Darwin, refuse to lower it, and the grader must not crash
  on that guard there);
- a wall-clock deadline *independent of the test count*, in addition to the per-test
  ``SIGALRM``;
- deterministic child reaping with no Manager server to leak;
- child identification at spawn (pid, test count, deadline).

It is library-consumable, not only route-internal: an RL reward path can call :func:`run`
synchronously per trajectory and derive a binary or fractional reward from the per-test
outcomes. Inputs are the normalized LCB test list -- call-based or stdin, with an optional
``fn_name`` -- plus the extracted program; both stop-on-failure short-circuiting and
collect-all are preserved. Concurrent callers are supported: each run is its own process and
the parent never waits unbounded.
