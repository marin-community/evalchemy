# OpenAI MRCR

`MRCR` evaluates long-context multi-round co-reference resolution using the
corrected [`openai/mrcr`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/mrcr) dataset.
The dataset revision and its six parquet shards are pinned so scores do not
change when the Hub repository changes.

MRCR requires an explicit `--max_length`. It selects only complete published
context-length bins supported by that window, interleaves the 2-, 4-, and
8-needle cells, and routes each rendered prompt through Evalchemy's shared
endpoint context preflight before transport. `--limit` applies to this balanced
order; `--debug` selects two examples when no smaller explicit limit is
provided.

```bash
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/marin-community/evalchemy[mrcr]" eval \
  --model local-chat-completions \
  --tasks MRCR \
  --max_length 131072 \
  --max_tokens 4096 \
  --model_args model=served,base_url=http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
```

Results include the official nonce-gated `SequenceMatcher` score as
`mrcr_accuracy`, `prefix_hit_rate`, and a metric plus sample count for each
evaluated context-length × needle-count cell.
